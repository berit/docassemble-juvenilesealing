question: Can You Seal Your Massachusetts Juvenile Records?
subquestion: |

  Sealing your juvenile record means that most people
  and employers won't see anything at all about your
  juvenile record. (You can read more in the GBLS CORI Booklet.?)
  (Sealing is different than expunging.?)
  There are rules about when you can
  and can't seal your juvenile records.

  These are the steps we'll do with you
  to find out if you can try to seal your records:

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if we think you can seal your records.
  
  Then you can get your form right away or let us help
  you fill in the other parts too - things like your name
  and social security number.

  After that you'll need to:

  1. Print the form.
  1. Sign the form in two places.
  1. Mail the form to the Commissioner of Probation. We'll
  give you the address.

  ## Questions and Answers
    
  ### How long does it take to finish?
  
  It can take up to **40 minutes** to answer all the questions,
  though it's usually less.

  ### What do I need to know to be able to answer the questions?

  You need to know about your old and open cases. That includes
  cases in other states and federal cases. Having
  {a copy of your criminal records}
  can help you know the answers to the questions.
  
  ### What about my privacy?
  
  If we need to store anything about your identity,
  like your name and social security number,
  we will ask you first.

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA
  that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

subquestion: |
  There are times when it is important to have certified copies of
  your docket sheets for all your cases.

  If you're not a US citizen, it can be very important to have
  the copies for a hearing. They can also help for:

  * Getting jobs that need a federal background check
  * Applying for some government programs (like the Social Equity program)
  * Taking legal action because someone did something wrong in the case
  * Whenever you need to prove what happened in the case.

  Once you seal your records you'll have to unseal them to get
  certified copies. That can sometimes take a while.

  Do you want to get certified copies of your docket sheets before
  filling out the form to seal your records?
