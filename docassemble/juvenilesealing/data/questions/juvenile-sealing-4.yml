  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - Don't ask personal info until we know they want to print the form.
  - Personal info code can look like https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  Do objects always need to be in their own file?
  If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?
comment: |
  Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?
