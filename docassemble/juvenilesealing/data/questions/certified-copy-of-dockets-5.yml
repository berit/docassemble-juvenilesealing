  Currently, the way for legal professionals/volunteers
  to avoid answering extra questions. Also, to avoid some
  personal questions being stored with the rest of the data.

  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.

question: You may need your docket sheets to get some jobs
subquestion: |
  Some criminal charges may stop you from getting
  certain kinds of jobs. If you seal your records,
  there are a few agencies and a few types of employers
  who can get CORI reports that have information about
  sealed records. They may also ask you some
  questions about your sealed records.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets
  for all of your cases,  you can prove what happened
  in your case.** This may help you get the job.
  You can always unseal your records, but it will take
  more time.

  ${how_to_get_certified_copies}

#  Only some crimes will stop you from getting those jobs.
#  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for
#  all of your cases you can
#  prove what your record really is** and maybe still get
#  the job. You can always unseal your records, but it will
#  take more time.
  
#  **It can take a while, but we recommend you get
#  a certified copy of your docket sheets
#  before trying to seal your records**. We can link you to a
#  different website
#  **(TODO: Need name of website)** with instructions.
