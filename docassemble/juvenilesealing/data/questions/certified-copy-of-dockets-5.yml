  Currently, the way for legal professionals/volunteers
  to avoid answering extra questions. Also, to avoid some
  personal questions being stored with the rest of the data.

  TODO: For example, if you seal the case, you might not be
  able to get papers you need from the
  sealed court file in time for an immigration hearing.
  TODO: Juvenile delinquency is same as conviction? Can just
  do one question for MA and other states?
  TODO: Can I take a stab at a simplified version of the
  sealing info form?
  TODO: Some work with children is ok?
  TODO: 'WHO CAN SEE JUVENILE CASES ON A CORI REPORT?' - before
  or after sealing?
  TODO: 'may' to 'can'? Really go over language with a fine-toothed
  comb
  TODO: Add info about how to get dockets plus costs
  TODO: Say need juvenile records in later interview too
  TODO: Say... something. Don't remember.
  TODO: Fix 'url' instead of 'Try Sealing'
  TODO: How about records from other states?

question: Can You Seal Your Juvenile Record?
subquestion: |
  To find out, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.
  
  After that, we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  #### More about this form
  
  <span style="color: green">If you have the information you need,</span>
  these questions
  can take about to **15 minutes** to answer.
  It will be easier to give the right answers if you
  have a copy of your juvenile record report,
  and also your CORI report if you had cases in an adult court.
  These reports will give a summary of all your criminal charges
  and tell you how each case ended.

  ${getting_juvenile_records} ${getting_cori}

  You also might have to
  stop and come back later if you need to
  get a certified copy of your docket sheets.
  
  If we need to store any personally
  identifying information,
  like your name and social
  security number, we will ask you first.

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

  - TODO: Add link to expungement info
  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.
    [Answer: Before]
question: Certified Copies of Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  **Do you already have a certified copy of docket sheets for
  all of your cases?**

  Note: A docket sheet is different than a
  criminal record or juvenile report called a CORI. Docket sheets are
  papers in your court case at the courthouse that say
  what happened in each of your cases every time you went to court.

question: Sealing can be a bad idea for immigrants
subquestion: |
  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records before
  the hearing. ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say  whether you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for all
  of your cases, you can prove what really happened in your case.**
  
  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: You may need your docket sheets to get some jobs
subquestion: |
  Some criminal charges may stop you from getting
  certain kinds of jobs. If you seal your records,
  there are a few agencies and a few types of employers
  who can get CORI reports that have information about
  sealed records. They may also ask you some
  questions about your sealed records.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets
  for all of your cases,  you can prove what happened
  in your case.** This may help you get the job.
  You can always unseal your records, but it will take
  more time.

  ${how_to_get_copies}

#  Only some crimes will stop you from getting those jobs.
#  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for
#  all of your cases you can
#  prove what your record really is** and maybe still get
#  the job. You can always unseal your records, but it will
#  take more time.
  
#  **It can take a while, but we recommend you get
#  a certified copy of your docket sheets
#  before trying to seal your records**. We can link you to a
#  different website
#  **(TODO: Need name of website)** with instructions.
