question: Can You Seal Your Juvenile Record?
subquestion: |
  To find out, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Make sure it's ok to seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.
  
  After that we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  
  #### <span style="background: yellow">More about this form</span>
  
  <span style="background: yellow">The questions can take up to
  20 minutes (check this!) to get through.
  They will be easier to
  answer right if you have your CORI with you. Click
  [here](https://icori.chs.state.ma.us/icori/ext/global/landing.action?page=1&bod=1566991096995&m=presentLanding)
  to go to the Massachusetts iCORI site
  and create an account for requesting your CORI.
  You also might have to
  stop this form and come back later if you need to
  get a certified copy of your docket sheets.</span>
  
  <span style="background: yellow">If we need to store any personally
  identifying information we will ask you first.</span>

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

  - TODO: Add link to expungement info
  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.
question: Certified Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  **Do you already have a certified copy of docket sheets for
  all of your cases?**

  Note: A docket sheet is different than a
  criminal record report called a CORI. Docket sheets are
  papers in your court case at the courthouse that say
  what happened in your case.

question: Sealing can be dangerous for immigrants
subquestion: |
  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records before
  the hearing. <span style="background: yellow">ICE could decide
  to treat it like a very serious crime.</span>
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets
  for all of your cases you can
  prove what your record really is.**
  
  **Please get a certified copy of
  the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying
  to seal your records**. Click
  here to go to a different
  website **(Need name of website)**

question: You may need your docket sheets to get a job
subquestion: |
  Only some crimes will stop you from getting those jobs.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases you can
  prove what your record really is** and maybe still get
  the job. You can always unseal your records, but it will
  take more time.
  
  **It can take a while, but we recommend you get
  a certified copy of your docket sheets
  before trying to seal your records**. We can link you to a
  different website **(Need name of website)** with instructions.
