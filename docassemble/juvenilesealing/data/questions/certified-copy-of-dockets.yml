  - Q: Is this relevant to juvenile records?
    A: Yes. Some people can see you have sealed juvi records.
  - Q: Are 'dockets' the same thing as your criminal record?
  - Q: What do sealed records look like to the employer?
  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.
  - Possibly include in explanation:
  If you get a **certified copy of your juvenile docket sheets for
  all of your cases** you'll
  be able to show them exactly what your crime was and they might
  still be able to hire you. The problem is that when your records
  are sealed you can't get the docket sheets. You'll have to
  unseal them to be able to show your employer. That can take a
  while.

  Warning: Get a certified copy of your docket sheets before sealing
subquestion: |
  Dockets are different than your criminal record (CORI)

  **There are times when showing the criminal docket sheets for
  all of your cases is very
  important,** especially if you're an immigrant or want
  certain jobs.
  
  ## Why?

  If you seal your record most people can't even see you have
  a record. Some special jobs and situations will let people
  see that you have a record, but won't show what's in that
  record. They could think that you committed a very serious
  crime. **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets
  for all of your cases
  you can prove what your record really is.**

  ## What To Do
  You can only get a copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases **before** you seal
  your records. This site will tell you how to get a **certified
  copy of the criminal docket sheets for all of your cases**:

  ## When Does it Matter?

  These are times when people can see you have a sealed record:

  1. If you're an **immigrant** and you have to go to court.
  1. If the person is a police officer or a judge.
  1. If you're applying for a job that needs FBI clearance. For
  example:
      * Working with children under 18
      * Working for a political office
      * Running for political office
      * Working for a bank
      * A job with the military
      * Working for an employer who participates in the Work
     Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program

  You can always un-seal your records to get a copy, but sometimes
  it will take too long. We recomment getting a **certified copy**
  of the docket sheets for all of your cases **before** you seal
  your records.
  
  Do you want to get the docket sheets now or do you want to
  find out if you're eligible first?
