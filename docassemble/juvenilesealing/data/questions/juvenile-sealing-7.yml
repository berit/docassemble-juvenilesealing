  - Do objects always need to be in the file in which they are used?
    [No]
  - If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?
  - Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?
objects:
  - applicant: Individual
  - ineligibility_reasons: DAObject
