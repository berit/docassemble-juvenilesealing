    papers from the courthouse that say
    what happened in a case every time
    you went to court for that case.
    
    Sadly, every case has its own docket sheets and
    those sheets are kept at the courthouse that handled
    that case. To get the certified copies
    of juvenile or adult docket sheets of a case, you
    must go to the clerk’s office in the courthouse that
    handled that case. You can say, "I'd like certified copies
    of my docket sheets for all of my cases." You must
    do this for all of your cases.
    
    It can sometimes cost about $2.50 for each page,
    but if you can't affort to pay that much, you
    can ask, "Can I get the fee waived?" The staff
    will probably have you fill out a form called an
    “affidavit of indigency” where you'll put down
    how much you and the family members that live with you
    get payed. That's to show why you can't afford
    to pay the fee.
    
    You can also send a letter to ask for the docket sheets,
    but that isn't as good. It costs more, it
    takes longer, and it could take a couple of tries.
    If you want to order the sheets by mail, first call
    the courthouse and ask how much it will cost to
    print the sheets.
    <span style="color: red">
    Then write a letter that says, TODO: what does it say?
    </span>.
    Next write a check for the amount of money
    the courthouse wants. Put those both in an envelope to
    mail to the courthouse. Remember to include your return
