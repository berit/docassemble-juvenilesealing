  Questions
  1. TODO: Timing? Took 20 min. for legal students. Say 30 min.?
  1b. They have a form for something else that seems to
    work really well. They'll send it over just for us to get a gander.
  2. TODO: What if there is no legal help in their area?
  answer: That's a tough question. There are lots of little
    things to persue.
    - Go to courthouse of any court where
    you have a case and talk to somebody in probation, for example.
    - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.
    - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  3. TODO: Link to info on CORI FAQ - CORI wrong, what it is etc.?
    answer: mass legal help website about that
    todo: will send link. Also, though, de-emphasize getting records
  4. TODO: ADDRESS TO MAIL IT TO
  answer: at top of form. copy from there
  5. further resources:
  answer: Will send
    - applying for jobs booklet (will be put online)
    - cori and housing
    - employment
    - Big know your cori rights booklet

  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - Don't ask personal info until we know they want to print the form.
  - Personal info code can look like https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  - Do objects always need to be in their own file?
  - If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?

  - Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?
objects:
  - applicant: Individual
  - ineligibility_reasons: DAObject

  Sorry, we can't help until you have more information

  It looks like you don't know enough about your records.

  To ask for a free copy of your MASSACHUSETTS
  juvenile record, <span style="color: green">mail in</span> a
  [Juvenile Record Request form](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/09/pt/juv-rec-req.pdf).
  <span style="color: red">I can't see it, even when I download it.</span>
  To ask for your <span style="color: green">online</span>
  adult CORI report, create an account at
  [Massachusetts iCORI site](https://icori.chs.state.ma.us/icori/ext/global/landing.action?page=1&bod=1566991096995&m=presentLanding).
  It costs $25, but if you are low income you might be be able
  to ask for waiver of the fee.
  Those will help you answer the questions.

  **Get your CORI and come
  back soon so we can
  help seal your records!**
