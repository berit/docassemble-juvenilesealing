  Currently, the way for legal professionals/volunteers
  to avoid answering extra questions. Also, to avoid some
  personal questions being stored with the rest of the data.
  
  TODO: For example, if you seal the case, you might not be
  able to get papers you need from the
  sealed court file in time for an immigration hearing.
  TODO: Juvenile delinquency is same as conviction? Can just
  do one question for MA and other states?
  TODO: Can I take a stab at a simplified version of the
  sealing info form?
  TODO: Some work with children is ok?
  TODO: 'WHO CAN SEE JUVENILE CASES ON A CORI REPORT?' - before
  or after sealing?
  TODO: 'may' to 'can'? Really go over language with a fine-toothed
  comb

  - TODO: Add link to expungement info
  - TODO: More detailed description page along with instructions?
  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.

question: Sealing can be a bad idea for immigrants
subquestion: |
  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records before
  the hearing. ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say  whether you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for all
  of your cases, you can prove what really happened in your case.**
  
  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: You may need your docket sheets to get some jobs
subquestion: |
  Some criminal charges may stop you from getting
  certain kinds of jobs. If you seal your records,
  there are a few agencies and a few types of employers
  who can get CORI reports that have information about
  sealed records. They may also ask you some
  questions about your sealed records.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets
  for all of your cases,  you can prove what happened
  in your case.** This may help you get the job.
  You can always unseal your records, but it will take
  more time.

  ${how_to_get_copies}

#  Only some crimes will stop you from getting those jobs.
#  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for
#  all of your cases you can
#  prove what your record really is** and maybe still get
#  the job. You can always unseal your records, but it will
#  take more time.
  
#  **It can take a while, but we recommend you get
#  a certified copy of your docket sheets
#  before trying to seal your records**. We can link you to a
#  different website
#  **(TODO: Need name of website)** with instructions.
