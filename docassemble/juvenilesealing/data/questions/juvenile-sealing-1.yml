  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - Don't ask personal info until we know they want to print the form.
  - Personal info code can look like https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  Do objects always need to be in their own file?
  If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?
comment: |
  Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?
objects:
  - applicant: Individual
  - user: DAObject
  - ineligibility_reasons: DAObject

question: This will not be shown to users
subquestion: |
  We still have some questions:

  * A conviction or dissmisal means you
  had an open case, but an open case can be other things like
  probation. If a juvenile case has been open (like probation)
  in the last three years the person can't seal. If an adult
  was on probation in the last three years, can they seal?
  * Does the language about 'convictions from the district court,
  superior court, Boston Municipal Court, federal court, or
  any out-of-state court' tell us about whether this was a criminal
  case? If it was an out-of-state court, could it have been a
  non-criminal case?
  * Would the petitioners generally know the kind of court it
  happened in? Specifically something like the district court vs.
  superior court?

question: Can You Seal Your Juvenile Record?
subquestion: |
  You might be able to seal your juvenile record. This is what we'll do:
  
  1. We'll ask questions about your open cases and old cases.
  1. We'll tell you if you have a good chance of getting your record sealed.
  1. We'll ask if you want us to fill out your form (petition).
  1. If you say yes, we'll ask you questions about yourself like your name and social security number.
  1. We'll make a form (petition) for you to download, print, and sign.
  1. We'll tell you where to mail the petition to.

  To you want to keep going?
