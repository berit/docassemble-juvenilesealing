  personal questions being stored with the rest of the data.

  - TODO: Add link to expungement info
  - TODO: Should we show this before or after we see if they're
    eligible or not? Having them go through the whole thing
    just to have to come back in the future would be a pain.
    On the other hand, having them go through the trouble
    of getting a certified copy and then not be eligible is
    also not great.
question: Before trying to seal your records we have an important question
subquestion: |
  **Do you already have a certified copy of your dockets?**
  (A docket is different than a criminal record - CORI)
  
  **Important!** Expunging is different than sealing.

yesno: have_docket_copies_already

question: Sealing can be dangerous for immigrants
subquestion: |
  **If you have a certified copy of your dockets you can
  prove what your record really is.** If you seal your
  records without getting a **certified copy
  of your dockets first** and ICE requires a hearing, you may
  not have time to unseal those records before the hearing.
  
  Please get a **certified copy of your dockets before trying
  to seal your records**. Follow this link for a site with
  instructions:

question: You may need your dockets to get a job
subquestion: |
  Only some crimes will stop you from getting those jobs.
  **If you have a certified copy of your dockets you can
  prove what your record really is** and maybe still get
  the job. You can always unseal your records, but it will
  take more time.
  
  We recommend you get a **certified copy of your dockets
  before trying to seal your records**. We can link you to a
  site with instructions.
